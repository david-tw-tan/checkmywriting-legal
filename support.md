## Common Questions

### App Functionality

**Q: How do I upload my writing for feedback?**
A: You can upload writing in two ways: take a photo of your writing using the camera button, or paste text directly into the app. If using a photo, you can crop it to focus on the text you want analyzed.

**Q: What types of feedback does the app provide?**
A: Check My Writing provides three types of feedback:
- **Grammar Feedback (✍️)**: Grammar corrections and improvements
- **Concise Feedback (✂️)**: Making writing more concise and clear
- **Enrich Feedback (🌈)**: Enhancing vocabulary and descriptive language

**Q: What happens to my writing samples if I delete and reinstall the app?**
A: Your writing samples and feedback history are stored in your account. If you delete the app and reinstall it, you can sign back in to access your previous work.

**Q: Can I use the app offline?**
A: Basic features work offline, but AI-powered writing analysis requires an internet connection to process your writing and provide feedback.

**Q: Is my writing stored securely?**
A: Yes. Your writing samples are stored securely using encrypted cloud storage. We take your privacy seriously and never share your writing with third parties.

### Subscriptions

**Q: How do subscriptions work?**
A: Check My Writing offers auto-renewing subscriptions (Monthly and Yearly plans) for both Individual and Family plans. You can cancel anytime through your Apple ID settings.

**Q: What's the difference between Free and Premium?**
A: Free users receive 3 writing analyses per month with basic feedback. Premium subscribers get unlimited analyses with comprehensive feedback including advanced grammar analysis, style suggestions, and progress tracking.

**Q: How do I cancel my subscription?**
A: Cancel through your iPhone Settings → [Your Name] → Subscriptions → Check My Writing. You can also manage subscriptions directly on [apple.com](https://apple.com).

**Q: What's the difference between Individual and Family plans?**
A: Family plans allow you to share your subscription with up to 6 family members through Apple Family Sharing. This is perfect for families with multiple students who want to improve their writing.

**Q: Can I get a refund?**
A: Refund requests are handled through Apple's App Store policies. Contact Apple Support for subscription refunds.

**Q: I subscribed but don't have access. What should I do?**
A: Try tapping "Restore Purchases" in the app settings. If that doesn't work, contact us with your purchase receipt.

**Q: How many writing analyses do I get with my subscription?**
A: Premium subscribers get unlimited writing analyses. Free users receive 3 analyses per month, which reset at the beginning of each month.

### Technical Issues

**Q: The app crashes or freezes. What can I do?**
A: Try force-closing the app and restarting it. If the issue persists, try restarting your device. If problems continue, contact support.

**Q: I can't upload a photo of my writing.**
A: Check that camera permissions are enabled in Settings → Check My Writing → Camera. Also ensure your device's camera is not blocked or covered. Make sure you have a stable internet connection when uploading.

**Q: The AI feedback isn't loading.**
A: Make sure you have an active internet connection. AI-powered features require connectivity to process your writing. If you're connected but still having issues, try closing and reopening the app.

**Q: I can't see all my feedback history.**
A: Make sure you're signed in to your account. Your feedback history is tied to your account and requires authentication to view.

**Q: The photo cropping feature isn't working.**
A: Try taking a new photo with better lighting and ensure the text is clearly visible. If the issue persists, you can paste your text directly instead of using a photo.

### Privacy and Data

**Q: What data do you collect?**
A: We collect minimal data necessary to provide the service: your email address (for account creation), writing samples you upload, and anonymous usage data to improve the app. See our [Privacy Policy](https://david-tw-tan.github.io/checkmywriting-legal/privacy-policy) for details.

**Q: Is my writing shared with anyone?**
A: No. Your writing samples are private and are never shared with third parties. They are only used to provide you with personalized feedback.

**Q: Can I delete my writing samples?**
A: Yes. You can delete individual writing samples from your feedback history, or contact us to delete your entire account and all associated data.

**Q: Is the app safe for children?**
A: Yes. Check My Writing is designed for educational use by students in grades 3-6. We do not collect personal information from children under 13 without parental consent, and all writing samples are kept private and secure.
